### 1. Predicting Uber Ride Price

#### **Objective**:
To predict the fare of an Uber ride based on various factors, including pickup and drop-off locations. This task uses two different regression models, **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regression**, to evaluate and compare predictive performance.

#### **Theory**:
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Remove any irrelevant or erroneous data entries, handle missing values, and normalize data for consistency.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusual data points that might distort model predictions. For example, rides with extraordinarily high or low prices may be outliers.
   - **Correlation Check**: Calculate the correlation between features to identify which variables influence fare predictions the most.

2. **Algorithms**:
   - **Linear Regression**:
     - **Overview**: Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm for predicting a continuous output. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features (independent variables) and the output (dependent variable).
     - **Model Equation**: The model can be represented as \( y = wX + b \), where \( w \) is the weight, \( X \) is the input feature, and \( b \) is the bias.
     - **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used to quantify the difference between predicted and actual fare values. The MSE loss function calculates the average of the squared differences between predictions and actual values.
     - **Optimization (Gradient Descent)**: Gradient Descent adjusts the weights in small steps to minimize the error iteratively until the minimum error is reached.

   - **Random Forest Regression**:
     - **Overview**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees, each trained on different random subsets of data and features. The predictions from all trees are averaged for regression tasks.
     - **Bagging Technique**: Random sampling is used to create multiple datasets (bootstrap sampling), allowing each decision tree to be trained on a unique subset, enhancing prediction diversity and reducing overfitting.
     - **Aggregation**: Predictions from individual trees are averaged (in regression tasks) to produce a robust and generalized final output.
     - **Advantages**: Random forests are highly accurate and handle high-dimensional data effectively. They are less prone to overfitting than single decision trees.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **R-squared (R²)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. A higher R² indicates a better fit.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of absolute errors between predicted and actual values, giving an intuitive measure of prediction accuracy.
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values, which penalizes larger errors.

### 2. Email Spam Detection Using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#### **Objective**:
To classify emails as spam or not spam (binary classification) using **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithms. The goal is to evaluate and compare these two methods on accuracy and classification performance.

#### **Theory**:
1. **Dataset Preprocessing**:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Remove or fill missing values, convert categorical data into numerical form, and standardize or normalize features if needed.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Analyze the dataset to create or refine features that might improve the classification (e.g., frequency of certain keywords).
   - **Train-Test Split**: Divide data into training and testing sets to train the model on one subset and evaluate it on another to prevent overfitting.

2. **Algorithms**:
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**:
     - **Overview**: K-NN is a simple, non-parametric, instance-based algorithm that classifies new data points based on their similarity to known examples.
     - **Distance Metric**: Commonly uses **Euclidean distance** to measure similarity. For each new email, K-NN calculates its distance to all training examples and assigns the label based on the majority vote among the nearest K neighbors.
     - **Parameter K**: The value of \( K \) significantly influences model performance. A small \( K \) might lead to overfitting, while a large \( K \) could dilute the impact of close neighbors.
     - **Advantages**: K-NN is easy to implement and requires no training phase, making it suitable for small datasets.
     - **Disadvantages**: K-NN can be computationally expensive on large datasets due to the need to calculate distances to all points.

   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
     - **Overview**: SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes. It is particularly effective for high-dimensional data and cases where the classes are separable.
     - **Hyperplane**: The decision boundary in an SVM model, which maximizes the margin between two classes.
     - **Margin Maximization**: SVM aims to maximize the distance (margin) between the nearest points (support vectors) of each class and the hyperplane, which improves generalization.
     - **Kernel Trick**: For non-linear data, SVM uses kernel functions (e.g., polynomial, RBF) to project data into a higher-dimensional space where a linear separation is possible.
     - **Advantages**: SVM is effective on high-dimensional datasets and generally performs well in complex classification tasks.
     - **Disadvantages**: SVM can be slow to train, especially with large datasets, and requires careful tuning of hyperparameters like C and kernel parameters.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Confusion Matrix**: A table that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, useful for calculating other metrics.
   - **Precision**: The ratio of true positives to the total predicted positives, indicating how many predicted spam emails are actually spam.
   - **Recall**: The ratio of true positives to all actual positives, showing how well the model detects spam emails.
   - **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the two when they have different importances. High F1 scores indicate balanced precision and recall.
   - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances, though it can be misleading if the classes are imbalanced.

### 3. Gradient Descent Algorithm to Find Local Minima

#### **Objective**:
To implement the **Gradient Descent** optimization algorithm and find the local minimum of a function, such as \( y = (x + 3)^2 \) starting from an initial point.

#### **Theory**:
1. **Gradient Descent**:
   - **Overview**: Gradient Descent is an optimization technique used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting parameters. It’s commonly used in machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Initialize Parameters**: Start with an initial guess for \( x \) and choose a learning rate (\( \alpha \)), which controls the step size in each iteration.
     - **Compute Gradient**: Calculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to \( x \).
     - **Update Parameters**: Adjust \( x \) by moving in the direction opposite to the gradient by a fraction defined by the learning rate.
     - **Repeat** until the change in \( x \) is smaller than a specified tolerance or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
   - **Learning Rate**: The learning rate is a critical parameter; a too-large value may overshoot the minimum, while a too-small value can lead to slow convergence.
   - **Stopping Condition**: Gradient descent stops when the difference between consecutive \( x \)-values falls below a set threshold (precision).

2. **Applications**:
   - Finding minima of complex functions in various machine learning algorithms and adjusting parameters in models to minimize error.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Final Value of \( x \)**: Indicates where the function reaches its minimum.
   - **Convergence Speed**: The number of iterations taken to reach the minimum.

### 4. Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using Neural Networks

#### **Objective**:
To build a **Neural Network** model that predicts if a bank customer will leave the bank within six months. This experiment involves implementing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify customer churn.

#### **Theory**:
1. **Neural Networks**:
   - **Overview**: Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, with multiple layers of nodes (neurons) that learn complex patterns in data. They are powerful for classification tasks, particularly on complex and large datasets.
   - **Architecture**:
     - **Input Layer**: Contains nodes representing features of each customer (e.g., age, balance, transactions).
     - **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers where neurons apply transformations to capture complex patterns.
     - **Output Layer**: Produces the final classification (churn or no churn).
   - **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions applied to each neuron’s output, including:
     - **Sigmoid**: Often used in the output layer for binary classification, mapping output between 0 and 1.
     - **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): Common in hidden layers due to its efficiency in training deep networks.
   
2. **Training Process**:
   - **Forward Propagation**: Input data passes through the network, and each layer applies weights and activation functions to produce predictions.
   - **Loss Calculation**: Measures the difference between

 predicted and actual outputs, commonly using binary cross-entropy for binary classification tasks.
   - **Backpropagation and Weight Update**: The algorithm calculates gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight and adjusts weights to minimize error.

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Summarizes true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, aiding in precision and recall calculations.
   - **Precision and Recall**: Provide insights into the model’s reliability in identifying customers likely to churn.
